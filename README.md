# CrimeAnalysis

This project aims to predict crimes in different states in the USA.
One of the possible applications of this project would be to predict the possibility of crime and if possible, take preventive measures.


The datasets used are : [Crimes in Boston]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston]), [Denver Crime Data]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data]) and the [Philadelphia Crime Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/philadelphiacrimedata]) .

This project was made as a part of the course - UE21EC352B Machine Learning and Applications.
